                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p> My name is Nathaniel Wilson. I am a 4th year computer science student at Dalhousie University with a passion for all aspects of the industry.
                        From database design to front end development, and everything in between I always strive to achieve my best. Over the course of my degree
                        I have become an adaptive learner who can quickly pick up new skills as I go. My driven personality has allowed me to succeed in even them most challenging circumstances.
                        I excel at working both independtly and in a group enivorments as I am hard working and easy to get along with. Outside of my professional life I enjoy traveling, fitness, 
                        and football.

                    Web application using Python's Flask library that will allow users to create a list
                    of tasks they need to complete. It can be hosted using a AWS EC2 Istance IaaS, with a backend built upon AWS's NoSQL DynamoDB for its cost-effective flexabile storage. 
                    The Application was created with RESTful principles in mind, and makes use of an API Gateway with multiple HTTP endpoints to control traffic from the web application 
                    to Lambda functions that access the database. This helps extrapolate responsibility and spread it around as well as removing code that does not need to be running at all times in an EC2, converting
                    them to a FaaS model.

                <p> This application works to simulate the process of a distrubuted transaction accross multiple databases. Within the github repository there are three applications with their corresponding databases:
                    Company X and Y, which simulate Participants, and Company Z which represents a Controller. Company Z takes advantage of its position as a controller to produce a middle-man like product to its clients.

                <h2>Android Trading App</h2>
                <p>My group and I developed an android application for users to trade items between each other. The app featured a messaging system, a map with markers indicating near by users who wish to trade,
                   as well as a reputation feature where users could post a review about their experience interacting with another user. The technologies we used included: Java, Espresso testing, Mockitio Testing and Android Studio, and was
                   developed using Agile Methodoligies.

                <h2>E-commerce Website</h2>
                <p> With the use of PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, a team of 4 and I created a mock E-commerce website. Using session cookies, we were able to successfully
                    keep track of each user's activity and implement a shopping cart feature. To provide a more streamline experience for users, we adopted Ajax for asynchronous operations such as sending data 
                    back and forth from the relational database backend.
