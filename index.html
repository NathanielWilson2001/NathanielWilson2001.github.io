                <p>My group and I developed an android application for users to trade items between each other. The app featured a messaging system, a map with markers indicating near by users who wish to trade,
                   as well as a reputation feature where users could post a review about their experience interacting with another user. The technologies we used included: Java, Espresso testing, Mockitio Testing and Android Studio, and was
                   developed using Agile Methodoligies.
